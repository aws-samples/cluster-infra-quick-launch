## cluster-infra-quick-launch

Quick launch your cluster with more additional features.

We leverage project [awsome-distributed-training](https://github.com/aws-samples/awsome-distributed-training), and integrate the fragmented Cluster building processes as well as building hierachical Storage layers.

For more details, our public blog can be referred, including the explainations of the building process, also the performance analysis of the checkpointing process.
